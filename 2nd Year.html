	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online-based
	digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services.
	It has significantly transformed the way brands and businesses utilize technology for marketing since the 1990s and 2000s. As digital 
	platforms became increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life,and as people increasingly used digital devices instead
	of visiting physical shops,digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing combinations of search engine optimization (SEO),
	search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing,
	e-commerce marketing, social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, e-books, and optical
	disks and games have become commonplace. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as television, 
	mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callbacks, and on-hold mobile ringtones.The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing 
	from online marketing.</td>

	of the data type.<br>The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.Different types of data structures are suited to different 
	kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data
	retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.<br>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of 
	data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient 
	algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor
	in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</td>

    The development of software engineering was seen as a struggle. Problems included software that was over budget, exceeded deadlines, required 
	extensive debugging and maintenance, and unsuccessfully met the needs of consumers or was never even completed.<br>In 1968, NATO held the first 
	software engineering conference where issues related to software were addressed. Guidelines and best practices for the development of software
	were established.<br>The origins of the term software engineering have been attributed to various sources. The term appeared in a list of services
	offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of "Computers and Automation" and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications
	of the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) in "President's Letter to the ACM Membership" by Anthony A. Oettinger.It is also associated with the title of a
	NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer. Margaret Hamilton described the discipline of "software engineering" during the Apollo 
	missions to give what they were doing legitimacy.At the time there was perceived to be a "software crisis".The 40th International Conference on
	Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) celebrates 50 years of "Software Engineering" with the Plenary Sessions' keynotes of Frederick Brooks and Margaret 
	Hamilton.</td>

	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>In physics, angular frequency (symbol ω), also called angular speed and angular rate, is a scalar measure
	of the angle rate (the angle per unit time) or the temporal rate of change of the phase argument of a sinusoidal waveform or sine function (for example,
	in oscillations and waves). Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the pseudovector quantity angular velocity.<br>Angular frequency can be
	obtained multiplying rotational frequency, ν (or ordinary frequency, f) by a full turn (2π radians): ω = 2π rad⋅ν. It can also be formulated as ω = dθ/dt,
	the instantaneous rate of change of the angular displacement, θ, with respect to time, t.<br>In SI units, angular frequency is normally presented in the unit
	radian per second. The unit hertz (Hz) is dimensionally equivalent, but by convention it is only used for frequency f, never for angular frequency ω.
	This convention is used to help avoid the confusion[4] that arises when dealing with quantities such as frequency and angular quantities because the units
	of measure (such as cycle or radian) are considered to be one and hence may be omitted when expressing quantities in terms of SI units.<br>In digital signal
	processing, the frequency may be normalized by the sampling rate, yielding the normalized frequency.</td>

	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.It was originally created by
	Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.PHP was 
	originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.<br>PHP code is usually
	processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server,
	the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the
	whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed
	to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, 
	such as standalone graphical applications and drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.<br>The standard PHP
	interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most 
	web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with 
	the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.<br>W3Techs reports that as of 23 May 2024 
	(the six months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP is used by 76.2% of all websites whose programming language could be determined, and 55.1% thereof
	use PHP 7 which is outdated and known to be insecure.</td>

	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>The term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing
	the term.Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data 
	within a tolerable elapsed time.Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data; however, the main focus is on unstructured
	data.Big data "size" is a constantly moving target; as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.Big data requires a set of
	techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.<br>"Volume", 
	"variety", "velocity", and various other "Vs" are added by some organizations to describe it, a revision challenged by some industry authorities.The Vs of
	big data were often referred to as the "three Vs", "four Vs", and "five Vs". They represented the qualities of big data in volume, variety, velocity, veracity,
	and value.Variability is often included as an additional quality of big data.<br>A 2018 definition states "Big data is where parallel computing tools are
	needed to handle data", and notes, "This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, 
	and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model."<br>In a comparative study of big datasets, Kitchin and McArdle found 
	that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases.For this reason, other studies identified
	the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait.Instead of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of big data, this 
	alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected, stored, 
	made available and analyzed.</td>

	Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described 
	in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, 
	Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected 
	into one block.Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<br>The first
	decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important 
	way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize
	the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin,
	where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<br>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all 
	transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to 
	January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.The words block and chain were used
	separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.</td>

	was suggested early on.Efforts to support social networks via computer-mediated communication were made in many early online services, including Usenet,
	ARPANET, LISTSERV, and bulletin board services (BBS). Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as 
	The Source, Delphi, America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, and The WELL.<br>Early social networking on the World Wide Web began in the form of generalized
	online communities such as Theglobe.com (1995),Geocities (1994) and Tripod.com (1995). Many of these early communities focused on bringing people together 
	to interact with each other through chat rooms and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal web pages by providing easy-to-use
	publishing tools and free or inexpensive web space. Some communities – such as Classmates.com – took a different approach by simply having people link to each
	other via email addresses. PlanetAll started in 1996.<br>In the late 1990s, user profiles became a central feature of social networking sites, allowing users
	to compile lists of "friends" and search for other users with similar interests. New social networking methods were developed by the end of the 1990s, and many
	sites began to develop more advanced features for users to find and manage friends.Open Diary, a community for online diarists, invented both friends-only 
	content and the reader comment, two features of social networks important to user interaction.</td>

	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,
	which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation
	"Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.<br>PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve
	the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" on the Usenet discussion group comp.
	infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995.This release included basic functionality such as Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed
	HTML. By this point, the syntax had changed to resemble that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent.<br>Early PHP was never intended to
	be a new programming language; rather, it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it [...] there was never any intent to
	write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language [...] I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."
	A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.<br>.</td>
